This document serves as a comprehensive manual for the Statistical Genomics course at Washington State University (WSU), 2025, instructed by Dr. Zhiwu Zhang. It is developed as part of the course assignments and provides a step-by-step tutorial on performing Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using General Linear Models (GLM) with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correction. We compare our method against GWASbyCor, Blink C, and Machine learning models (RandomForest & XGboost) using simulations and evaluate performance using ROC curves.
