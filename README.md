This package performs Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using General Linear Models (GLM) with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correction. We compare our method against GWASbyCor, Blink C, and Machine learning models (RandomForest & XGboost) using simulations and evaluate performance using ROC curves.
